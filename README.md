## Hi! ðŸ––

My name is Leon Mac. <br>
I am currently enrolled in a Master's program in Computer Science at Cracow University of Technology.

### About me
I have discovered my passion for programming and computer science during my 1st semester of University, while studying a different degree - Automatic Control and Robotics. <br>
After the initial semester I decided to switch both my University and major, to Applied Computer Science at Cracow University of Technology. <br>
That led to me receiving my Bachelor of Engineering degree in January of 2025. <br>
Since February 2025, I have been enrolled in a Master's program in Computer Science - Data Science.

### ðŸŒ± Looking for a job! 
I am interested in a position where I will be able to utilize and expand my skills, grow and do interesting things! <br>
